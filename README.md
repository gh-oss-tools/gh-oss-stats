# gh-oss-stats

A Go library + CLI tool that fetches a GitHub user's open source contributions to external repositories (repos they don't own) and outputs structured JSON.

## Features

- 🔍 **Find External Contributions**: Discovers merged PRs to repositories you don't own
- 📊 **Aggregate Statistics**: Calculates total PRs, commits, lines of code changed
- 🎨 **SVG Badge Generation**: Create beautiful badges in 4 styles (summary, compact, detailed, minimal)
- ⭐ **Repository Filtering**: Filter by minimum star count
- 🚦 **Rate Limit Handling**: Smart rate limit detection with exponential backoff
- 📦 **Library-First Design**: Use as a Go library or standalone CLI

## Usage

1. Navigate to your github profile repo
1. Create new file `.github/workflows/generate-oss-badge.yaml`
3. Copy content of [.github/workflows/generate-oss-badge-sample.yaml](.github/workflows/generate-oss-badge-sample.yaml)
